# Chatbot UI Website

This project is a responsive chatbot UI website designed to provide users with an interactive and engaging experience. It leverages Next.js for its server-side rendering capabilities, allowing for faster page loads and better search engine optimization. Tailwind CSS is used to style the UI components, providing a flexible and efficient way to design modern interfaces. Additionally, the MagicUI library is integrated to enhance specific UI elements or functionality requirements, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The chatbot functionality is implemented using predefined messages to respond to user inputs. These messages are designed to simulate a conversation with the user and provide relevant information or assistance based on their queries.

## Instructions to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
 git clone https://github.com/bhavyakashmira/chatbot_epyc

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
